# SMA Intelligence Platform

An end-to-end platform for building, testing, and analyzing trading strategies based on Simple Moving Averages (SMA), with extensions into machine learning, signal generation, and agent-based analysis. A simulation of Raul's original analysis. Their README is in 'RAUL_README.md'

## Overview

This project brings together market data processing, SMA-based strategy logic, machine learning models, and lightweight AI agents into a single system. It’s designed to support both experimentation and structured analysis of trading signals.

The platform includes:

* A backend API for data, signals, and models
* A frontend for visualization and interaction
* Supporting pipelines for ML and retrieval-based workflows

## Core Components

### Backend

Built with FastAPI. Handles:

* Market data access
* SMA calculations
* Signal generation
* ML inference
* Agent endpoints

### Services Layer

Contains most of the logic:

* `market_data.py` – data ingestion and retrieval
* `sma_engine.py` – moving average calculations
* `signal_engine.py` – trading signals
* `feature_engine.py` – feature generation for ML
* `ml_model.py` – model loading and predictions
* `backtester.py` – strategy evaluation

### Agents

Simple task-focused agents:

* Research agent for context and summaries
* Signal agent for explaining outputs
* Anomaly agent for detecting irregular patterns

### Frontend

React-based UI with:

* Charting
* SMA controls
* Signal display
* ML output panel
* Agent chat interface
* Economic impact simulation dashboard

### Economics Simulation (Mocked)

Currently using mocked data, this module evaluates and injects macroeconomic factors into the platform:

* Federal funds rate changes
* Inflation data and CPI
* Simulated impact of macroeconomic variables on SMA strategies and asset classes

### ML Pipeline

Located in `/ml`:

* Feature construction
* Model training
* Evaluation scripts

### RAG Components

Used for retrieval-based responses:

* Embedding generation
* Vector storage
* Query-time retrieval

## Setup

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/sma-intelligence-platform.git
cd sma-intelligence-platform
```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file (local development only):

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/sma_db
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
KAFKA_BROKER=kafka:9092

# Local Dev API Keys (Required for external integrations and AI agents)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key_here
ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alphavantage_api_key_here
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key_here
```

## Running the project

### With Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Once running, the application will be exposed on the following ports:
* **Frontend UI**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* **Backend API**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

*(Troubleshooting note: If Postgres fails to start with "init.sql: error: could not read from input file: Is a directory", run `docker-compose down -v` to clear cached volume bindings and run `docker-compose up --build` again.)*

### Backend (local)

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## API

* `/market` – market data
* `/signals` – generated signals
* `/ml` – model predictions
* `/agents` – agent interaction

---

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

---

## Data Flow (simplified)

1. Data ingestion (`market_data.py`)
2. Feature generation (`feature_engine.py`)
3. SMA calculation (`sma_engine.py`)
4. Signal generation (`signal_engine.py`)
5. ML prediction (`ml_model.py`)
6. Backtesting (`backtester.py`)
7. Agent interaction (`agents/`)

## Current Mocked Data Implementation

While the platform is designed to connect to live data sources, local development currently uses mocked data generators in the `backend/app/api/` routes to simulate market conditions:

* **Market Data (`market.py`)**: Generates 60 days of simulated OHLCV data. It produces a slow-trending price walk with randomized daily fluctuations and automatically calculates simulated 50-day and 200-day SMA offsets for charting.
* **Signals (`signals.py`)**: Simulates real-time trading signals ("Precision Buying", "Automated Short", "Dark Pool Accumulation", "Magnetized Order") triggered across various SMA outfits (e.g., 10/50/200, 30/60/90) with randomized confidence metrics.
* **Agents (`agents.py`)**: Simulates an AI analyst returning pre-scripted domain-specific observations about bullish divergences, dark pool accumulation, and automated order execution.
* **Machine Learning (`ml.py`)**: Mocks a predictive engine (labeled `v1.0-mock`) that returns randomized directional biases ("Up", "Down", "Neutral") and probability scores.
* **Economics (`economics.py`)**: Mocks macroeconomic conditions by generating randomized but realistic ranges for Interest Rates (4.5-5.5%), Inflation/CPI, GDP Growth, and Unemployment alongside directional statuses (Rising/Falling).

* Use the platform to analyze Raul's system more deeply and improve on it.
* Improve the UI/UX.
* Potentially deploy the frontend and backend in a more user-friendly way, as an application.
* Integrate real finance APIs like Yahoo Finance's via yfinance 1.3.0, AlphaVantage, Finnhub, or Polygon.io.
* Consider adding AI-powered signal generation and analysis, potentially using large language models to interpret market data and generate trading signals. This would allow the platform to identify complex patterns and relationships that might not be apparent through traditional technical analysis.
* In the agents section, integrate LLMs like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 to provide more sophisticated analysis and insights. This would allow the platform to identify complex patterns and relationships that might not be apparent through traditional technical analysis.
